# __Kindalab__ Coding Challenge

## Specifications

Chosen project:

- Name: Food Trucks.
- Description: Create a service that tells the user what **types** of **food trucks** might be found **near** a specific **location** on a **map**.
- Keywords: Types, Food Trucks, Near, Location, Map
- Interpetation: What I understand from the project description, is that I'll have to build an application that allows the user to provide a certain location on a form (maybe to a text input or maybe to latitude and longitude numeric fields) and then display on a map component what TYPES of "Food Trucks" can be found near that location with little components that represent a food truck and also maybe a list of those foodtrucks with more details about it.
